Difference between constructor chaining and method chaining :
	1. Recursion could be identified at compile time in constructor chaining but in method chaining it could be identified at run time.
	2. In constructor chaining if you want to call other constructor then , you have to use "this" keyword and it should be the 1st statement of a constructor, but in method chaining 
		you can call another method by it's name and there is no restriction that method calling statement could be the 1st statement or the last statement.
