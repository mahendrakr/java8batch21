Class: It is a blueprint (design/concept) from where we can create an object.
Purpose of a class in java, To represent a real world category.
How can we represent a category in java? Represent animal, student, dog
We can represent category in java with the help of class.
For example 
class Animal{}
class Student{}
class Dog{}
syntax of a class in java 
class <Name><{}>[;]


Object: It is an instance of a class.
It has properties (variables). 
It has behaviours(method).

How to create a variable in java 
<datatype> <variable name> <;>
Example
 int age; 
String name;
 float fee;

How to create a method in java ?
	[modifiers] <return type> <method name> <()> <{}> [;]
	for example : 
		void read(){} {doesn't return value}
		int getAge(){
		return 18;
		}
		String getNmae(){
		return "Aadi";
		}
		int add(int a , int b , int c){
		return a+b+c;
		}
		void m1(int age , String name){
		}
		
	How can we access variables and method ?
		step 1 : Create an object of the class, say (Student , Teacher, Animal, Employee)
					Student stu = new Student();
					Employee e = new Employee();
					Animal a = new Animal();
					Teacher t = new Teacher();
		step 2 : 	<refrence variable name> <.> <variable name/method name><;>
					e.g; String name = stu.getName();

	Good Programmers write code that Humans can understand ."
		
	Identifiers (Any name in java is identifier)
	For example:
    It could be a class name .(Class name must start with capital letter and it should be noun and it should start with alphabet)
	It could be a method name.( Method name should be a combination of verb and noun )
	It could be an argument name .
