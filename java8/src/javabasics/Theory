Class: It is a blueprint (design/concept) from where we can create an object.
Purpose of a class in java, To represent a real world category.
How can we represent a category in java? Represent animal, student, dog
We can represent category in java with the help of class.
For example 
class Animal{}
class Student{}
class Dog{}
syntax of a class in java 
class <Name><{}>[;]


Object: It is an instance of a class.
It has properties (variables). 
It has behaviours(method).

How to create a variable in java 
<datatype> <variable name> <;>
Example
 int age; 
String name;
 float fee;

How to create a method in java ?
	[modifiers] <return type> <method name> <()> <{}> [;]
	for example : 
		void read(){} {doesn't return value}
		int getAge(){
		return 18;
		}
		String getNmae(){
		return "Aadi";
		}
		int add(int a , int b , int c){
		return a+b+c;
		}
		void m1(int age , String name){
		}
		
	How can we access variables and method ?
		step 1 : Create an object of the class, say (Student , Teacher, Animal, Employee)
					Student stu = new Student();
					Employee e = new Employee();
					Animal a = new Animal();
					Teacher t = new Teacher();
		step 2 :

	Good Programmers write code that Humans can understand ."
		
	Identifiers (Any name in java is identifier)
	For example:
    It could be a class name .(Class name must start with capital letter and it should be noun and it should start with alphabet)
	It could be a method name.( Method name should be a combination of verb and noun )
	It could be an argument name .
	It could be a variable name .(It follow the same rule of class)
	
	NOTE: Class ,Variable ,Argument name should be a Noun .
	Variable name should be a Verb or  verb combination(getName ) .
	
	ques. Difference between static or non static members/ Instance members.
	Ans.(1) To access instance members you must create an object first whereas for static members you can access without creating an object.
	(2) non static members consumes less memory as compare to static members.
	(3) non static members get memory when object is created whereas static members get memory at class loading time.
	(4) non static members can not access in static context whereas static members can be access from instance context.
	
	Block - There are two types of block 1. static block  2. non static block
	eg. static {}
	eg. {}
	Purpose - To initialize the variables apart from constructor 
	
	Constructor - To initialize the variables
	(1).constructor name must be same as class name 
	(2).Constructor does not have return type even the void
	(3).Valid modifiers for constructor PPP
